# ESS_Game

This repository contains some example code for how to run the ESS game environment. The current implementation of the ESS game environment relies on modified versions of OpenAI Baselines and OpenAI Gym.

## Requirements and Setup
The code is designed to run on Python 3, and Tensorflow, and also uses a Jupyter Notebook.

The modified OpenAI Gym and Baselines can be found below, which we recommend installing in a virtual environment.

To get the jupyter kernel to work with the packages in the virtual environment, you can set up according to e.g.:
